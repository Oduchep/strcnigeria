              History of STRC Owerri Mission
            </h3>
            <div className="text-lg">
              <p>
                Owerri STRC, Nigeria was formed in the year 2005 by some
                students of the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO)
                and a student of the Federal Polytechnic¸Nekede who were
                disheartened as a result of the numerous heresies, non-Catholic
                practices associated with the Vatican 2 Church.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                These men decided to leave the Novus Ordo after due consultation
                (through the help of their leader) with Bishop D. Dolan who
                later sent them a priest (Fr. Eldred Leslie) in the year 2006
                who helped to give the group a solid foundation, thus
                establishing a viable mission in Nigeria. The members were about
                11 men at the beginning. However, after these students graduated
                and some traveled to other parts of the country, especially
                Lagos and Port Harcourt, they helped to establish missions in
                these locations. Two members who remained in Owerri continued to
                sustain the group in Owerri as soon as they were back from their
                NYSC(Nigerian Youth Service Corps) programmes. Hence, by the
                year 2010, STRC, Nigeria had three branches, namely, STRC
                Owerri, STRC Port Harcourt and STRC Lagos, respectively.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                The group in Owerri received about this time the membership of a
                courageous lady who joined the group shortly after she was
                convinced concerning the errors of Vatican 2. And after the
                death of Father Leslie in 2011, the group through the
                benevolence of Bishop Dolan was visited by Frs. Carlos Ercoli
                and Julian Larabee before the ordination of Fr. Nkamuke in 2013.
                The Owerri group which was later named St. Louis De Montfort
                mission always met on Sundays for prayers and discussions on
                matters of Faith and Morals in one of the classrooms within St.
                Paul’s Primary School, off Douglas Road, Owerri. On Fridays of
                Lent, we initially held our Stations of the Cross in this
                Primary School for about two years, but later gathered (for the
                sake of convenience) at either the Pastoral Centre or the
                Carmelite Order both situated along Wetheral Road, Owerri for
                both the Stations of the Cross and the Sacred Heart devotion.
                The number of the members which was originally about four
                persons around 2010 increased to about twelve in 2014. Besides,
                we occasionally enjoyed visits by some brethren resident in Port
                Harcourt and Lagos.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                After Father Nkamuke&apos;s arrival in 2014, the Sunday Masses
                were held in a members house in Nekede, whereas we continued our
                Sunday meetings in St. Paul’s Primary School, Owerri, whenever
                the priest was not around. However, when the members
                progressively increased to a sizable number, the need to look
                for a more spacious and convenient place to accommodate the
                members arose. Consequently, in the year 2019, we rented an
                apartment which serves as our present chapel and houses some few
                young ladies answering the call to the religious vocation.
