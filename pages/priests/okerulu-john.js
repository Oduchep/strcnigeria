          About Fr. John Chukwuka Okerulu
        </h1>

        <div>
          <p className="text-lg mb-8">
            Rev. Fr. John Chukwuka D. Okerulu, was born on the 9th of January
            around the mid 90&apos;s and received infant baptism about a month
            later; He hails from Ogidi in Idemili-North Local Government Area of
            Anambra State, South-East geopolitical zone of Nigeria. He was born
            and bred in Portharcourt metropolitan capital city of Rivers State.
            Fr Okerulu was born into the family of late Dr Innocent-Mary Nweke
            Okerulu. He is the second son and last child of six children(four
            girls and two boys).
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg mb-8">
            He had his primary education in Aladumo Educational Center(now
            called Aladumo International School), Portharcourt. He had his
            Senior Secondary education in Uniport International Secondary
            School, Port harcourt, where he graduated in 2012, receiving
            certificates of both West African Senior School Certificate
            Examination(WASSCE) and National Examination Council(NECO).
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg mb-8">
            <em>&apos;The year 2012&apos;</em> Fr Okerulu writes{' '}
            <em>
              &apos;was a <strong>turning point</strong> in my life.&apos;
            </em>{' '}
            In this year he went often to the Novus Ordo Mass said albeit
            conservatively by the then parish priest, the late Monsignor
            Professor Festus Chukwudi Okafor(ordained 1963, died 2022). The
            devotion and love of this priest for Our Lady together with his
            constant sermon on devotion to Mary and the Holy Rosary caused him
            to join the 33days classes organized that year for making Total
            Consecration to Jesus through Mary according to the manner taught by
            St Louis de Montfort. He made his Total Consecration on the 15th of
            August, 2012.{' '}
            <em>
              &apos;Not so long after making this Total Consecration he writes
              &apos;I felt a strong desire to give my whole self in the service
              of Our Divine Lord. This desire I owe to Our Beloved Queen whom I
              had consecrated my whole being to. She indeed knows how to use the
              weak things of this world to procure God&apos;s Greater
              Glory.&apos; This commenced his vocation to the Priesthood!.
            </em>
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg mb-8">
            His desire for the Priesthood coincided{' '}
            <strong>providentially</strong> with his discovering the Traditional
            Latin Mass which was offered by the FSSP at Sacred Heart Minor
            Seminary, Rumuibekwe, Port harcourt. On discovering this treasure of
            treasures, he hid it as it were and out of a healthy curiosity he
            sought to know why this Mass was not celebrated in all parishes. In
            this search for the truth which was the theme of his daily rosaries,
            his desire to serve God as his minister increased and to this
            desire, was added the desire to say this Mass, the Traditional Latin
            Mass, which he had just discovered.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg mb-8">
            Due to his love for the Holy Rosary and on account of the knowledge
            he had that the Rosary was given to St Dominic, he sought to become
            a Dominican, thinking that the Dominican Order would at least have a
            special devotion to Our Lady&apos;s Holy Rosary. In 2015 he was
            invited for an interview as an aspirant. On arriving there, what he
            noticed about the New Mass, which he never wanted to say, was that
            it was even offered in a more irreverent way than he had ever seen.{' '}
            <em>
              Communion was given to the standing communicants and sometimes on
              the palm and not on the tongue. Women dressed as they liked to
              Church.
            </em>{' '}
            These things led him to quit his quest to join this order so loved
            by him even after he was admitted. He instead opted to study
            Philosophy at the Catholic Institute of West Africa(C.I.W.A), Port
            harcourt.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg mb-8">
            While studying Philosophy at CIWA, he kept making research about the
            Catholic faith. At this point he came across articles on the website{' '}
            <a
              className="text-blue-400"
              href="https://traditionalmass.org"

              rel="noreferrer"
            >
              Traditionalmass.org
            </a>{' '}
            written by Bishop Donald J. Sanborn and the late Fr Anthony J.
            Cekada on <strong>Sedevacantism</strong>. &apos;Their exposition of
            the false, erroneous and heretical doctrines promulgated by the
            council and how that could not be if those who promulgated them were
            true popes made it sufficiently clear to me that the only true and
            logical position a Catholic should hold after the fact of the Second
            Vatican Council and with these same agents of the Second Vatican
            Council posing as Popes of the Roman Catholic Church is
            Sedevacantism{' '}
            <em>
              (namely that the See of Rome is Vacant of a legal/de Jure
              possessor)
            </em>
            .&apos;
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg mb-8">
            In 2016, while still at CIWA because of his ardent zeal to spread
            the faith, his constant posts on Facebook concerning things
            pertaining to the faith made him to be contacted by a faithful of
            Fr. Nkamuke, who told him that Fr Nkamuke would be coming to
            celebrate Holy Week in Port harcourt. He partook in the Holy Week
            celebrations and received his first communion{' '}
            <strong>non una-cum(not in union with)</strong> the Novus Ordo Pope
            and Hierarchy on <strong>Maundy Thursday</strong> of 2016. During
            that week, he expressed his desire to be a Priest to Fr Nkamuke who
            said he could join the Seminary in 2016 of that year(at that time
            the Seminary was still unofficial as it had no name). Hence, he quit
            his studies of Philosophy at CIWA on June 29th, Feast of Sts Peter
            and Paul to pursue his vocation to the Priesthood at last.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg mb-8">
            On the 24th of September, 2016, He officially started his Seminary
            formation. This was the same year the Seminary officially started,
            for it received the name <strong>SEAT OF WISDOM SEMINARY</strong>{' '}
            (it now uses the Latin <em>SEDES SAPIENTIAE SEMINARY</em>) from its
            first Rector Fr Okechukwu Bede Nkamuke in 2016. In order to hasten
            his Seminary formation, Fr Okerulu was admitted into Most Holy
            Trinity Seminary, then in Brooksville, Florida, United States, in
            September of 2018; and eventually continued again as student of
            Sedes Sapientiae Seminary from June of 2021 while residing in Saint
            Getrude the Great Catholic Church, West Chester, Ohio, USA. After a
            thorough formation in Philosophy and Sacred Theology and in
            accordance with the provisions of Canon Law following the strict
            Rubrics of the liturgical ceremonies of Holy Mother Church, he
            ascended the Seven Steps unto the Altar of God beginning with the
            reception of Clerical Tonsure on July 24th, 2019,followed by four
            minor orders and two major orders. He received the last and seventh
            major order, the Priesthood on the 11th of May, 2022, in Saint
            Getrude the Great Catholic Church, West Chester, Ohio, USA, by His
            Excellency, the Most Rev. Rodrigo Da Silva.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg mb-8">
            Fr Okerulu has since returned to Nigeria and has joined the Clergy
            of the Society of Traditional Catholics(S.T.R.C). He now carries out
            the mission of being, <em>another Christ(alter Christus)</em> which
            he has so long yearned for, by bringing the True Mass, preaching and
            administering the Sacraments to the faithful scattered in over
            thirteen missions. Furthermore, He teaches at the Seminary and helps
            to give formation to the newly founded community of Benedictine
            monks and nuns.
